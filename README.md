# Transistor Sizing for Power, Delay, and PDP Optimization Using HSPICE

### üîπ Step 1: HSPICE Design & Functionality Verification

- Design the selected circuit in **HSPICE**.
- Simulate and **verify the functionality** of the circuit.

---

### üîπ Step 2: Minimum Width Analysis

- Determine **W<sub>min</sub>** (minimum width) for all transistors together.
- Calculate and **demonstrate improvements** in:
  - Average Power
  - Delay
  - Power-Delay Product (PDP)

---

### üîπ Step 3: Width Optimization via Scaling

- With **W<sub>min</sub>** as the lower bound:
  - Scale each transistor's width using different coefficients.
  - Determine the **optimal width coefficients** for each transistor.
  - Report optimal values for **delay**, **average power**, and **PDP**.

---

### üîπ Step 4: Comparative Analysis

- Compare the results of optimized scaling (from Step 4) with the base case (Step 3).
- Which width coefficients work best for:
  - Power Optimization
  - Delay Optimization
  - PDP Optimization
- Identify the **best trade-off configuration**.

### üîπ Step 5: Functional Correctness Check

- Examine whether resizing the transistors **affects functional correctness**.
- Provide analysis and justification.

### üìò Selected Circuit: X1

We selected the X1 circuit as assigned. The circuit consists of a combination of XOR and XNOR gates implemented using CMOS logic. A schematic of the circuit is shown below:

A ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄT1‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
   ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ
   T2     T3    T4
   ‚îÇ      ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ
B ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

> **Outputs**:  
> Y = XOR(A, B)  
> Y' = XNOR(A, B)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Functionality Verification in HSPICE

- The CMOS transistors (T1‚ÄìT4) were modeled using standard HSPICE syntax.
- A transient analysis was run to verify correct XOR/XNOR functionality.
- Simulation waveforms confirm the circuit behaves as expected:
  - Input A (waveform 1)
  - Input B (waveform 2)
  - XOR Output (waveform 3)
  - XNOR Output (waveform 4)

### üìâ Step 2: Determine Optimal Wmin for Power, Delay, PDP

- We swept transistor widths simultaneously and extracted the optimal values based on:
  - **Power Consumption**
  - **Propagation Delay**
  - **Power-Delay Product (PDP)**

**Results**:
| Parameter       | Optimal Width (nm) |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Power           | 260                |
| Delay           | ‚Üì with ‚Üë Width     |
| PDP             | ‚Üì with ‚Üë Width     |

**Key Observations**:
- Power is minimized around 260nm.
- Delay and PDP decrease as width increases due to lower resistance.

### üîç Step 3: Optimizing Each Transistor Individually

We introduced coefficients `K1` to `K6`, each multiplying `Wmin`, and performed a sweep for each:

```spice
.param K1=1 K2=1 K3=1 K4=1 K5=1 K6=1
M1 Y A B VDD PMOS W='K1*Wmin' ...
...
