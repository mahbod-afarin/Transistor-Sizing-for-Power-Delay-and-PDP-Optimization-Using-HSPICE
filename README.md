# Transistor Sizing for Power, Delay, and PDP Optimization Using HSPICE

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: HSPICE Design & Functionality Verification

- Design the selected circuit in **HSPICE**.
- Simulate and **verify the functionality** of the circuit.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Minimum Width Analysis

- Determine **W<sub>min</sub>** (minimum width) for all transistors together.
- Calculate and **demonstrate improvements** in:
  - Average Power
  - Delay
  - Power-Delay Product (PDP)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Width Optimization via Scaling

- With **W<sub>min</sub>** as the lower bound:
  - Scale each transistor's width using different coefficients.
  - Determine the **optimal width coefficients** for each transistor.
  - Report optimal values for **delay**, **average power**, and **PDP**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Comparative Analysis

- Compare the results of optimized scaling (from Step 4) with the base case (Step 3).
- Which width coefficients work best for:
  - Power Optimization
  - Delay Optimization
  - PDP Optimization
- Identify the **best trade-off configuration**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Functional Correctness Check

- Examine whether resizing the transistors **affects functional correctness**.
- Provide analysis and justification.
